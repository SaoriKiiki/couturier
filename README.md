Prototype Abstract: Analysing Time Perception Through Clock App Design

This project delves into the design and usability testing of a Clock App prototype designed by me, aiming to understand and enhance how users perceive and interact with time. Through meticulous user research, the project will explore diverse personas, their graphic image preferences, user journeys, and interaction patterns. A comprehensive design process will unfold, utilizing storyboards, sketches, and usability audits to refine the interface.
The core of the project lies in real-world testing. The meticulously crafted prototype will be presented to users, and their interactions and feedback will be documented and analyzed. This data will serve as the foundation for a comprehensive report, detailing scientific findings and insights into user behavior and time perception within the context of the Clock App.
This project not only promises a functional and user-friendly Clock App but also aspires to unveil valuable scientific Erkenntnisse regarding the interplay between human-computer interaction and the perception of time. By bridging the gap between design and science, this project seeks to contribute to a deeper understanding of how we experience and manage time in the digital age.
